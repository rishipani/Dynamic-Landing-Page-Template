# Interactive Navigation Menu

This project is a basic interactive navigation menu built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It includes features like a fixed navbar, scroll-based style changes, hover effects, dark/light mode toggle, and mobile responsiveness. I built it mainly to experiment with UI/UX features â€” not focused on writing a full README.

Feel free to explore or use parts of it in your own projects.
